# Iron Bank: contracts

These contracts are the open and transparent foundation of the Iron Bank.

Iron Bank uses the OpenZeppelin library as a source of audited smart
contracts.  OpenZeppelin is a library for writing secure [Smart Contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) on Ethereum.

With OpenZeppelin, you can build distributed applications, protocols and organizations:
- using common contract security patterns (See [Onward with Ethereum Smart Contract Security](https://medium.com/bitcorps-blog/onward-with-ethereum-smart-contract-security-97a827e47702#.y3kvdetbz))
- in the [Solidity language](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/).

## Getting Started

Iron Bank's contracts and OpenZeppelin integrate with [Truffle](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle), an Ethereum development environment. Please install Truffle and initialize your project with `truffle init`.

## Security
OpenZeppelin is meant to provide secure, tested and community-audited code, but please use common sense when doing anything that deals with real money! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions and any security problem you might experience.
